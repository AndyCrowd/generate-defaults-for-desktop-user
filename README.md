Manage so many as possible compressed files
All necessery componets for a fully functional visual desktop environment
( panel/tray/audio mixer+pulseaudio mixer in a tray/powermanager/time & date/language layout switcher )
Update manager/Notifier
Preset mime-types for default user
*
Base set up should contain:
One or two of each from above
Minimal lightweigth web browser and a big one
Language packs only for english and user specified
Office and text editor
Only filemanager that has support for compressed files

***

Many Linux distributions contains limted amount or just not enough of the programs on their installation CD/DVD,
some of them are missing programs in the official repositories that are common for normal use of the Internet.

Every linux distribution has own positive and negative sides depends on
User knowledge level
Special features
Official repository size and use of unofficial repositories if available
Computer type or out-of-the-box driver support
